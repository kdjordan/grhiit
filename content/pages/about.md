# THE FOUNDER

## Kevin Jordan, 51

Lifelong athlete. Decades of coaching real HIIT. No shortcuts, no gimmicks.

GRHIIT is my **escape-velocity project**: a way to help people build **mental grit, personal discipline, and physical resilience** using the simplest tools possible—their body and a timer.

This isn't a brand looking for a gimmick. It's a **method**—the one I trust with my own life and energy.

## THE MISSION

Build a training system that creates:
- **Mental toughness** that translates beyond the workout
- **Physical resilience** without equipment dependency
- **Discipline** that becomes a life skill

## THE METHOD

Refined over thousands of coaching hours:
- Real HIIT protocols, not Instagram trends
- Time-based intervals that push you into real oxygen debt
- Progressive overload that respects your CNS
- Bodyweight-only for universal accessibility

## THE PHILOSOPHY

**"All it takes is all you've got."**

We don't need your excuses. We need your effort.
We don't want your perfection. We want your consistency.
We don't promise easy. We promise effective.

## THE FUTURE

- **Now:** Building the community, teaching the method
- **Soon:** Mobile app with timers, progressions, and live sessions
- **Always:** Three live streams weekly, free forever

This is founder-led, coach-driven, and built on decades of real practice.

**Do hard things. On purpose.**
