Here’s the truth: A lot of men over 40 think they’re training hard—when in reality, they’re just exercising.
The difference?
Exercising = moving, sweating, and feeling tired.
Training = structured, progressive, with intent and measurable goals.
If your sets end with 4–5 reps left in the tank every time, you’re not giving your muscles a reason to adapt. You don’t have to train to failure, but you should be close—especially on your last working set.
“Comfort zones maintain. Challenge zones transform.”
