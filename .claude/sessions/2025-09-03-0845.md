## Session Overview
**Start Time:** September 3, 2025, 08:45

## Goals
- [To be defined based on today's tasks]

## Progress

## Agent #1 Progress

## Agent #2 Progress
- Fix AWS Amplify deployment issues with Nuxt Content and sqlite3
- Replace better-sqlite3 with sqlite3 in the web project
- Resolve workspace dependency errors during Amplify build

### Update - 2025-09-04 9:42 PM

**Summary**: Successfully deployed to AWS Amplify with filesystem-only mode and fixed articles rendering

**Git Changes**:
- No uncommitted changes
- Current branch: main (commit: 91609e3 "fix: update article slug handling and query method in Nuxt application")

**Todo Progress**: 4 completed, 0 in progress, 0 pending
- ‚úì Completed: Examine current Nuxt Content configuration
- ‚úì Completed: Configure Nuxt Content for filesystem-only mode  
- ‚úì Completed: Update build configuration for AWS Amplify
- ‚úì Completed: Fix articles rendering issue

**Issues Resolved**:
1. **Amplify Directory Navigation**: Fixed `cd apps/web` error in build command - removed redundant directory change since `appRoot: apps/web` already sets the context
2. **Nuxt Content API**: Fixed incorrect `queryCollection()` usage - replaced with proper Nuxt Content v2 `queryContent()` API
3. **Article Routing**: Fixed article links to use `article._path` instead of parsing `article.id`

**Code Changes**:
- **amplify.yml**: Removed SQLite dependencies, added `NUXT_CONTENT_DATABASE_TYPE=fs`, fixed build command
- **nuxt.config.ts**: Simplified content config for v2 filesystem mode
- **pages/articles/index.vue**: Updated to use `queryContent('/articles').where({ published: true }).find()`  
- **pages/articles/[...slug].vue**: Updated to use `queryContent('/articles', slug).findOne()`

**Results**: AWS Amplify deployment successful, articles now rendering properly on production site

### Update - 2025-09-04 2:59 PM

**Summary**: Cleaned up deployment architecture and prepared for React Native mobile app planning

**Git Changes**:
- Modified: .claude/CLAUDE.md, .claude/docs/architecture.md, .claude/sessions/2025-09-03-0845.md, prompt.md
- Deleted: amplify-libsql.yml, vercel.json
- Current branch: main (commit: 91609e3 "fix: update article slug handling and query method in Nuxt application")

**Todo Progress**: 2 completed, 1 in progress, 1 pending
- ‚úì Completed: Scan project for obsolete deployment configs
- ‚úì Completed: Remove Vercel-specific configuration files
- üîÑ In Progress: Plan React Native mobile app architecture
- ‚è≥ Pending: Create mobile app documentation

**Issues Resolved**:
1. **Project Cleanup**: Removed obsolete Vercel configuration files after successful AWS Amplify deployment
2. **Documentation Updates**: Updated CLAUDE.md and architecture.md to reflect successful AWS Amplify deployment status
3. **File Organization**: Moved CLAUDE.md to proper .claude/ directory location

**Code Changes**:
- **Removed Files**: vercel.json (obsolete Vercel config), amplify-libsql.yml (unused alternative config)
- **Updated Documentation**: CLAUDE.md now reflects successful AWS Amplify deployment, architecture.md shows resolved status
- **Session Management**: Moved CLAUDE.md to .claude/ directory for better organization

**Next Focus**: Planning React Native mobile app architecture and implementation approach for fitness application ecosystem

### Update - 2025-09-04 3:15 PM

**Summary**: Completed comprehensive React Native mobile app planning with viral sharing strategy and unified PRD

**Git Changes**:
- Modified: .claude/CLAUDE.md, .claude/docs/architecture.md, .claude/docs/purpose.md, apps/web/nuxt.config.ts, tailwind.config.js
- Added: .claude/docs/PRD-mobile-launch.md, mobile-architecture.md, interval-timer-requirements.md, training-philosophy.md
- Deleted: amplify-libsql.yml, vercel.json (cleanup obsolete deployment configs)
- Current branch: main (commit: 91609e3 "fix: update article slug handling and query method in Nuxt application")

**Todo Progress**: 4 completed, 0 in progress, 3 pending
- ‚úì Completed: Update mobile architecture documentation with user responses
- ‚úì Completed: Update mobile architecture with precise interval timing requirements  
- ‚úì Completed: Update documentation with work-to-rest ratio science and philosophy
- ‚úì Completed: Restructure PRD into unified ecosystem document

**Major Accomplishments**:
1. **Mobile App Architecture**: Defined Expo React Native approach with NativeWind, React Navigation, precision interval timer
2. **Training Philosophy Documentation**: Captured work-to-rest ratio science, "You vs You" philosophy, rep counting accountability
3. **Viral Sharing Strategy**: Detailed post-workout social sharing system with Midjourney templates for organic growth
4. **Unified PRD**: Single ecosystem document covering web + mobile platforms with clear dependencies and launch phases
5. **Interval Timer Requirements**: Precise technical specs for variable duration intervals (seconds to minutes) with mental toughness focus

**Key Technical Decisions Made**:
- **Framework**: Expo React Native (iOS-first) over bare React Native for beginner-friendly development
- **Navigation**: React Navigation v6 over Expo Router for familiarity coming from React background
- **Styling**: NativeWind (Tailwind for React Native) for consistency with web platform
- **Timer System**: Variable interval support (not limited to short intervals) for progressive difficulty
- **Architecture**: Monorepo integration with shared Supabase backend and CSV-driven workout definitions

**Critical Path Dependencies Identified**:
- Web admin panel for CSV workout upload must complete before mobile development can begin
- Viral sharing templates critical for organic growth - requires Midjourney design work
- Precision interval timer system is core differentiator - must be flawless
- Cross-platform subscription sync (web preferred, mobile App Store backup)

**Business Strategy Clarity**:
- Web platform: SEO content + user registration + admin tools + subscription management  
- Mobile platform: Core fitness experience + interval timer + viral sharing + user retention
- Growth strategy: Web SEO traffic ‚Üí Mobile engagement ‚Üí Viral social sharing ‚Üí Organic acquisition

**Ready for Next Phase**: Mobile app development environment setup and Expo project initialization within monorepo structure
